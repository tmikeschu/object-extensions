# Object Extensions

In Ruby, `map` and `reduce` can also be called on `Hash` instances. Hashes are
similar to JavaScript objects, consisting of `key: value` pairs.

This module extends the `Object.prototype` object by adding `map` and `reduce`
functions to be called on `Object` instances.

As shown in the examples, this can allow more fun an elegant approaches to transforming objects into other shapes and types.

Please reach out if you see room for improvement and/or extension ðŸ˜‡

**Code samples and npm import examples coming soon**.

## `Object.prototype.map`

The function argument must return an object:

```js
require('object-extensions') // imports an extended Object.prototype

const ages = { mike: 26, hannah: 25 }

const abbrevPlus10 = ages.map((name, age) => ({ [name[0]]: age + 10 }))

const capsSquared = ages.map((name, age) => ({ [name.toUpperCase()]: age * age }))

const justCubed = ages.map((name, age) => ({ [name]: age * age * age }))

const justReversed = ages.map((name, age) => ({ [name.split("").reverse().join("")]: age }))

const notAllowed = (name, age) => `${name.toUpperCase()}(${age})`

console.log(abbrevPlus10)         // => { m: 36, h: 35 }
console.log(capsSquared)          // => { MIKE: 676, HANNAH: 625 }
console.log(justCubed)            // => { mike: 17576, hannah: 15625 }
console.log(justReversed)         // => { ekim: 26, hannah: 25 }
console.log(ages.map(notAllowed)) // throw "Function must return an object {}";
```

## `Object.prototype.reduce`

```js
require('object-extensions')

const ages = { mike: 26, hannah: 25 }

const shortHand = ages
  .reduce((acc, name, age) => acc.concat(`${name[0]}(${age})`), [])

const stringLines = ages
  .reduce((acc, name, age) => acc + `${name} is ${age}\n`, "")

const parameterized = ages
  .reduce((acc, name, age) => acc.concat({ name, age }), [])

const names = parameterized.map(user => user.name)

console.log(shortHand)     // => [ "m(26)", "h(25)" ]
console.log(stringLines)   // => mike is 26
                           //    hannah is 25

console.log(parameterized) // => [ { name: 'mike', age: 26 },
                           //      { name: 'hannah', age: 25 } ]

console.log(names)         // => [ 'mike', 'hannah' ]
```

## Setup

To get your machine and this code friendly and acquainted:

Clone this repository using your preferred method and `cd` into it. If you're not sure, I
recommend the SSH route:

```
git clone git@github.com:tmikeschu/{object-extensions}.git
cd object-extensions
yarn install
```

## Testing

First things first: get a dopamine hit from a verdant test suite! Run the tests with:

```
yarn test
```

Then *read* the tests to get oriented with the application.
