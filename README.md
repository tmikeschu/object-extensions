# Object Extensions

![]() image or gif

In Ruby, `map` and `reduce` can also be called on `Hash` instances. Hashes are
similar to JavaScript objects, consisting of `key: value` pairs.

This module extends the `Object.prototype` object by adding `map` and `reduce`
functions to be called on `Object` instances.

**Code samples and npm import examples coming soon**.
